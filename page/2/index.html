        <p>All  through the calculus we are deling with quantitiles that are growing, and with rates of growth. We classify all quantities into two classes: constants and variables. Those which we regard as of fixed value, and call constants, we generally denote algebraically by letters from the beginning of the alphabet, such as $a$, $b$ or $c$; while those which we consider as capable of growing, or ( as mathematicians say ) of “varying”, we denote by letters from the end of alphabet, such as $x$, $y$, $z$, $u$, $v$, $w$ or sometimes $t$.</p>
<p>Moreover, we are usually dealing with more than one variable at onece, and thinging of the way in which one variable depends on the time of attainint that height. Or we are asked to consider a rectangle of given area, and to enquire how any increase in the length of it will compel a corresponding decrease in the breadth of it. Or we think of the way in which any variation in the slope of ladder will cause the height that it reaches, to vary.</p>
<p>Suppose we have got two such variables that depend one on the other. An alteration in one will bring about an alteration in the other. <em>beacuse</em> of this dependence. Let us call one of the variables $x$, and the other that depends on it $y$.</p>
<p>Suppose we make $x$$ to vary, that is to say, we either alter it or imagine it to be altered, by adding to it a bit which we call $dx$. We are thus causing $x$ to become $y +dy$. Here the bit $dy$ may be in some case positive, in others negative; and it won’t(except by a miracle) be the same size as $dx$</p>
<p>#<center id="pic1"><img src="/2020/04/25/CALCULUS%20MADE%20EASY/3.ON%20RELATIVE%20GROWINGS/3/022a.pdf.png-1.png" alt></center></p>
<p>Take two examples.</p>
<p>(1)Let $x$ and $y$ be respectively the base and the height of right-angled triangle(<a href="#pic1">Figure 4</a>), of which the slope of the other side is fixed at $30^°$. If we suppose this triangle to expand and yet keep its angles the same as at first, then, when the base grows so as to become $x + dx$, the height of wihch is $dy$, and the base of which is $dx$, is similar to the original triangle; and it is obvious that the ratio $\frac {dy} {dx}$ is the same as that of the ratio $\frac {x}{y}$. As the angle is $30^°$ it will be seen that here<br>$$\frac{dy}{dy} = \frac{1}{1.73}.$$</p>
<p>(2)Let $x$ represent, in <a href="#pic2">Figure 5</a>, the horizontal distance, from a wall, of the bottom end of a ladder, $AB$, of fixed length; and let $y$ be the height it reaches up the wall. Now $y$ clearly depends on $x$. It is easy to see that, if we pull the bottom end $A$ a bit further from the wall, the top end $B$ will come down a little lower. Let us state this in scientific language. If we increase $x$ to $x + dx$, then $y$ will become $y - dy$; that is, when $x$ receives a positive increment, the increment which results to $y$ is negative.</p>
<p> #<center id="pic1"><img src="/2020/04/25/CALCULUS%20MADE%20EASY/3.ON%20RELATIVE%20GROWINGS/3/023a.pdf.png-1.png" alt></center></p>
<p>Yes, but how much? Suppose the ladder was so long that when the bottom end $A$ was $19$ inches from the wall the top en $B$ reached just $15$ feet from the ground. Now, if you were to pull the bottom end out 1 inch more, how much would the top end come down? Put it all into inches:$x = 19$ inches, $ y = 180$ inches. Now the increment of $x$ which we call $dx$ is 1 inch: or $x + dx = 20$ inches.  </p>
<p>How much will $y$ be diminished? The new height will be $y - dy$. If we work out the height by Euclid I. 47, then we shall be able to find how much $dy$ will be. The length of the ladder is</p>
<p>$$\sqrt{(180)^2 + (19)^2} = 181 inches  $$  </p>
<p>Clearly then, the new height, which is $y - dy$, will be such that<br>$$(y - dy)^2 = (181)^2 - (20)^2 = 32761 - 400 = 32361,$$<br>$$ y - dy = \sqrt{32361} = 179.89 inches $$</p>
<p>Now $y$ is 180, so that $dy$ is 180 - 179.89 = 0.11 inch.<br>So we see that making $dx$ an increase of $1$ inch has resulted in making $dy$ a decrease of $0.11$ inch.  </p>
<p>And the ratio of $dy$ to $dx$ may be stated thus:</p>
<p>$$ \frac {dy} {dx} = - \frac {0.11} {1}.$$</p>
<p>It is also easy to see that ( except in one particular position ) dy will be of a different size from $dx$.</p>
<p>Now right through the differential calculus we are hunting, hunting, hunting for a curious thing, a mere ratio, namely, the proportion which $dy$ bears to $dx$ when both of them are indefinitely small.</p>
<p>It should be noted here that we can only find this ratio $\frac {dy} {dy}$ when  $y$ and $x$ are related to each other in some way, so that whenever $x$ varies $y$ does vary also. For instance, in the first example just taken, if the base $x$ of the triangle be made longer, the height $y$ of the triangle becomes greater also, and in the second example, it the distance $x$ of the foot of decreases in a corresponding manner, slowly at first, but more and more rapidly as $x$ becomes greater. In the these case the relation between $x$ and $y$ is perfectly defininte, it can be experessed mathematicially, being $\frac {x} {y} = tan30^°$ and $x^2$ + $y^2$ = $l^2$ ( where $l$ is the length of the ladder ) respectively, and $\frac {dy} {dx} has the meaning we found in each case.  </p>
<p> If, while $x$ is, as before, the distance of the foot of the ladder from the wall, $y$ is instead of height reached, the horizontal length of the wall, or the number of bricks in it, or the number of years since it was built, any change in $x$ would naturally cause no change whatever in $y$; in this case $\frac {dy} {dx}$ has no meaning whatever, and it is not possible to find an expression for it. Whenever we use differential $dx, dy, dz,$ etc., the existence of some kind of relation between $x,y,z,etc$. is implied, and this relation is called a “function”  in $x, y, z, etc$; the two expressions given above for instance, namely $\frac {x} {y} = tan30^°$ and $x^2 + y^2 = l^2$, are functions of $x$ and $y$. Such expressions contain implicitly ( that is, contain without distinctly showing it ) the means of expressing either $x$ in terms of $y$ or $y$ terms of $x$, and for this reason they are called $implicit~functions$ in $x$ and $y$; they can be respectively put into the forms.</p>
<p>$$ y<del>=</del>x<del>tan30^° ~</del>or<del>~  x</del>=<del>\frac {y} {tan30^°}$$<br>$$ and</del>y = \sqrt {l^2- x^2}<del>or</del>x<del>=</del>\sqrt {l^2- y^2} $$</p>
<p>These last expression state explicitly ( that is, distinctly ) the value of $x$ in term of $y$ in terms of $x$, and they are for this reason called $explicit function$ of $x$ or $y$. For example $x^2 + 3 = 2y -7$ is an implicit function in x and y; it may be written $y = \frac {x^2 + 10} {2}$ ( explicit function of $x$ ) or $x=\sqrt {2y-10}$ (explicit function of $y$). We see that an explicit function in $x,<del>y,</del>z,<del>etc/$., is simply someting the value of which changes when $x,</del>y,<del>z,</del>etc$., are changing, either one at the time or several together. Because of this, the value of the explicit function is called the $dependent variable$, as it depends on the value of the other variable quantities in the function; these other variables are called the $independent variables$ because their value is not determined from the value assumed by the function. For example, if $u$ = $x^2sin\theta$ and  $\theta$ are the independent variables, and $u$ is the dependent variable.   </p>
<p>Sometimes the exact relation between several quantities $x,<del>y,</del>z$ either is not known or it is not convenient to state it; it is only known, or convenient to state, that there is some sort of relation between these variables, so that one cannot alter either $x$ or $y$ or $z$ singly without affecting the other quantities; the existence of function in $x,<del>y,</del>z$ either is not known or it is not convenient to state it; it is only known, or convenient to state, that there is some sort of relation between these variables, so that one cannot alter either $x$ or $y$ or $z$ singly without affecting the other quantitiesl the existence of a function in $x$ , $y$ ,$z$ is then indicated by the notation $F(x,y,z)$ (implicit function) or by $x=F(y, z)$, $y=F(x,z)$ or $z=F(x,y)$(explicit function). Sometimes the letter $f$ or $\phi$ is used instead of $F$, so that $y=F(x)$,$y=f(x)$ and $y=\phi(x)$ all mean the same thing, namely, that the value of y depends on the value of $x$ in some way which is not stated.</p>
<p>We call the ratio $\frac {dy} {dx}$ “$the<del>differential</del>coefficient<del>of</del>y$”. It is solemn scientific name for this very simple thing. But we are not going to be frightened by solemn names, when the things themselves are so easy. Instead of being frightened we will simply pronounce a brief curse on the stupidity of giving long crack-jaw names; and, having relieved our minds, will go on to the simple thing itself, namely the ratio $\frac {dy} {dx}$.</p>
<p>In ordinary algebra which you learned at school, you were always hunting after some unkown quantity which you called $x$ or $y$; or sometimes there were two unkown quantities to be hunted for simultaneouly. You have now to learn to go hunting in a new way; the fox being now neither $x$ nor $y$. Instead of this you have to hunt for this curious cub called $\frac {dy} {dx}$. The process of finding the value of $\frac {dy} {dx}$ is called “differentiating”. But, remember, what is the value of this ratio when both $dy$ and $dx$ are themselves indefinintely small. The true value of the differential coefficient is that to which it approximates in the limiting case when each of them is considered as infinitesimally minute.</p>
<p>Let us now learn how to go in quest of $\frac {dy} {dx}$.</p>
<h2 id="NOTE-TO-CHAPTER-III"><a href="#NOTE-TO-CHAPTER-III" class="headerlink" title=" NOTE TO CHAPTER III."></a><center> NOTE TO CHAPTER III.</center></h2><h2 id="HOW-TO-READ-DIFFERENTIALS"><a href="#HOW-TO-READ-DIFFERENTIALS" class="headerlink" title=" HOW TO READ DIFFERENTIALS "></a><center> HOW TO READ DIFFERENTIALS </center></h2><p>It will never do to fall into the schoolboy error of thinking that $dx$ mean $d$ time $x$, for $d$ is not a factor-it means “an elemeng of” or “a bit of” whatever follows. One reads $dx$ thus: “dee-eks”.</p>
<p>In case the reader has no one to guide him in such matters it may here be simply said that one reads diffreential coefficients in the following way. The diffreetial coefficient $\frac {dy} {dt}$ is read “dee-wy by dee-eks”, or “dee-way over dee-eks”.</p>
<p>So also $\frac {du} {dt}$ is read “dee-you by dee-tee”.</p>
<p>Second differetial coefficients will be met with later on. They are like this:$\frac {d^2y} {dx^2}$; which is read “dee-two-wy over dee-eks-squared”, and it means that the operation of differentiating $y$ with respect to $x$ has been ( or has to be ) performed twice over.</p>
<p>Another way of indicating that a function has been differentiated is by putting an accent to the symbol of the function. Thus if $y$ = $F(x)$, which means that $y$ is some unspecified function of $x$ see <a href="#func">here</a>, we may write $F’(x)$ instead of $\frac {d(F(x))} {dx}$. Similarly, $F^”(x)$ will mean that the original function $F(x)$ has been differentiated twice over with respect ot $x$.</p>

        <p>8We shall that in our processes of calculation we have to deal with small quantities of various degrees of smallness.</p>
<p>We shall have also to learn under what circumstances we may consider small quantities to be minute that we may omit them from consideration. Evenything depends upon relative minuteness.</p>
<p>Before we fix any rules let us think of some familiar cases. There are 60 minutes in the hour, 24 hours in the day, <strong>7</strong> day in the week. There are therefore <strong>1440</strong> minutes in day and <strong>10080</strong> minutes in the week.</p>
<p>Obviously 1 minute is a very samll quantity of time compared with a whole week. Indeed, our forefathers considered it small as compared with an hour, and called it “one minute”, meaning a minute fraction-namely one sixtieth-of an hour. When they came to require still small subdivisions of time, they divided each minute into <strong>60</strong> still smaller parts, which, in Queen Elizabeth’s days, they called “second minutes” ($i.e$.:small quantities of the second order of minuteness). Nowadays we call these small quantities of the second order of samllness “second”. But few people know $why$ $they$ $are$ $so$ $called.$</p>
<p>Now if one minutes is so small as compared with a whole day, how much smaller by comparison is one second!</p>
<p>Again, think of farthing as compared with a sovereign: it is barely worth more than $\frac {1} {1000}$ part. A farthing more or less is of precious little importance compared with a sovereign: it may certainly be regarded as a $small$ quantity. But compare a farthing with £1000: relatively to this greater sum, the farthing is of no more importance than  $\frac {1} {1000}$ of a farthing would be to a sovereign. Even a golden sovereign is relatively a negligible quantity in the weath of a millionaire.</p>
<p>Now if we fix upon any numerical fraction as constituting the proportion which for any purpose we call relatively small, we can easily state other fraction of a higher degree of smallness. Thus if, for the purpose of time, $\frac {1} {60}$ be called a $small$ fraction, then $\frac {1} {60}$ of $\frac {1} {60}$ ( being a small fraction of a small fraction ) may be regarded as small quantity of the second order of smallness.</p>
<p>*The mathematicians talk about the second order of “magnitude” ($i,e:greatness$) when they really mean second order of smallness. This is very confusing to beginners.</p>
<p>Or, if for any purpose we were to take <strong>1</strong> per cent. ($i,e:\frac {1} {100}$) as small fraction, then <strong>1</strong> per cent. of <strong>1</strong> per cent. ($i,e\frac {1} {10,000}$) would be small fraction of the second order of smallness; and $\frac {1} {1,000,000}$ would be a small fraction of third order of smallness, being <strong>1</strong> per cent. of <strong>1</strong> per cent. of <strong>1</strong> per cent</p>
<p>Lastly, suppose that for some very pricise purpose we should regard $\frac {1} {1,000,000}$ as “small”. Thus, if a first-rate chronometer is not to lose or gain more that halt a minute in purpose, we regard $\frac {1} {1,000,000}$( or one millionth ) as a small quantity, then $\frac {1} {1,000,000}$ of $\frac {1} {1,000,000}$, that is $\frac {1} {1,000,000,000,000}$ ( or one billionth ) will be a small quantity of the second order of smallness, and may be utterly disregarded by comparison.</p>
<p>Then we see that the smaller a small quantity itself is, the more negligible does the corresponding small quantity of the second order become. Hence we know that in all cases we are justified in neglecting the small quantities of the second-or third (or higher)-orders, if only we take the small quantity of the first order small enough in itself.</p>
<p>But, it must be remembered, that small quantites if they occur in our expressions as factors multiplied by some other factor, may become importance if the other factor is itself large. Even a farthing become important if only it is multiplied by a few hundred.</p>
<p>Now in the calculus we write $dx$ for a litte bit of $x$. These things such as $dx$ and $dv$, and $dy$, are called “differentials”, the differential of $x$ or of $y$, as the case may be. [Your read them as dee-eks, or dee-you, or dee-wy]. If $dx$ be a small bit of $x$, and relatively small of itself, it does not following that such quantities as $x · dx$，or $x^2 dx$ or $a^ x dx$ are negligible. But $dx×dx$ would be negligible, being a small quantity of the second order.</p>
<p>A very simple example will serve as illustration.</p>
<p>Let us think of $x$ as a quantity that can grow by a small amount so as to become $x + dx$ where $dx$ is the small increment added by growth. The square of this is $x^2 + 2x · dx +(dx)^2$. The second trem is not negligible because it is a first-order quantity; while the third term is of the second order of smallness, being a bit of, a bit of $x^2$. Thus if we took $dx$ to mean numerically, say, $\frac {2} {60}$ of $x$, then the second trem would $x^2$, whereas the third term would be $\frac {1} {3600}$ of $x^2$. This last term is clearly less important than the second. But if we go further and take $dx$ to mean only $\frac {1}{1000}$ of $x$, then the second term will be $\frac {2} {1000}$ of $x^2$, while the third term will be only $\frac {1} {1,000,000}$ of $x^2$.</p>
<p>#<center id="pic1"><img src="/2020/04/25/CALCULUS%20MADE%20EASY/2.ON%20DIFFERENT%20DEGREES%20OF%20SMALLNESS/2/018a.pdf.png-1.png" alt></center><br>#<center id="pic2"><img src="/2020/04/25/CALCULUS%20MADE%20EASY/2.ON%20DIFFERENT%20DEGREES%20OF%20SMALLNESS/2/019a.pdf.png-1.png" alt></center></p>
<p>Geometrically this may be depicted as follows: Draw a square(<a href="#pic1">Figure 1</a>) the side of which we will take to represent $x$. Now suppose the square to grow by having a bit $dx$ added to its size each way. The enlarged square is made up of area $x·dx$(or together $2x · dx$), and the little square at the top right-handd corner which is <strong>$(dx)^2$</strong>. In <a href="#pic2">Figure 1</a> we have taken $dx$ as quite a big fraction of x-about $\frac {1} {5}$. But suppose we had taken it only $\frac {1} {100}$-about the thickness of an inked line drawn with a fine pen. Then the little corner square will have an area of only $\fra {1} {10,000} of $x^2$, and be practically invisible. Clearly <strong>$(dx)^2$</strong> is negligible if only we consider the increment $dx$ to be itself small enough.</p>

<p>Let us consider a simile.</p>
<p>Suppose a millionaire were to say to his secretary:next week I will give you a small fraction of any money that comes in to me. Suppose that the secretary were to say to his boy: I will give you a small fraction of what I get. Suppose the fraction in each case to be $\frac {1} {100} part. Now if Mr.Millionaire received during the next week £1000, the secretary would receive £ 10 and the boy <strong>2</strong> shillings is a small small quantity indeed, of a very secondary order, But what would be a small quantity compared with £10000; but two shillings is a small small quantity indeed, of a very secondary order. But what would be the disproportion is the fraction, instead of being $\frac {1} {100}$, had been settled at $\frac {1} {1000}$ part ? Then, while Mr.Milionaire got his<br>£1000, Mr.Secretary would get only £1, and the boy less than one farthing!</p>
<p>The witty Dean Swift* once worte:</p>
<pre><code>So, Nat&apos;relists observer, a Flea
Hath smaller Fleas that on him prey
And these have smaller Fleas to bits&apos;em
And so proceed ad infinitum.</code></pre><p>*On Poetry: a Rhapsody (p. 20), printed 1733–usually misquoted.</p>
<p>An ox might worry about a flea of ordinary size-a small creature of the first order of smallness. But he would probably not trouble himself about a flea’s flea; being of the second order of smallness, it would be negligible. Even a gross of flea’s would not be of much account to the ox.</p>

        <p>The preliminary teeror, which chokes off most fifth-form boys from even attempting to learn how to calculate, can be abolished once for all by simply starting what is the meaning-in cocmmon-sense terms-of the two principal symbols that are used in calculating:</p>
<p>These dreaful symbols are:</p>
<p>(1) $d$ which mean a little bit of $x$; or $du$ means a little of bit of $u$. Ordinary mathematicians think it more polite to say “an element of”, instead of “a little bit of”. Just as you please. But you will fill that these little bits ( or element ) may be considered to be indefinitely small.</p>
<p>(2) $\int$ which is merely a long $S$, and may be called ( if you like ) “the sum of”.</p>
<p>The $\int dx$ means the sum of all the little bits of $x$; or $\int dt$ means the sum of all the little bits of $t$. Ordinary mathemticians call the symbol “the integral of”. Now any fool can see that if $x$ is considered as made up of a lot of little bits, each of which is called  $dx$, if you add them all up together you  get the sum of all th $dx$’s, ( which is the same thing as the whole of $x$ ). The word “integral” simply means “the whole.”, If you think of the duration of time for one hour, you may(if you like) think of it as cut up into <strong>3600</strong> little bits called seconds. The whole of the <strong>3600</strong> little bits added up together make one hour.  </p>
<p>When you see an expression that begins with this terrifying symbol, you will henceforth know that it is put there merely to give you instruction that you are now to perform the operation ( if you can ) of totalling up all little bit that are indicated by the symbols that follow.</p>
<p>That’s all.</p>
