        <p>In our equations we have regarded $x$ as growing, and as a result of $x$ being make to grow $y$ also changed ist value and grew. We usually think of $x$ as a quantity that we can vary; and, regarding the variation of $x$ as a sort of cause, we consider the resulting variation of $y$ as an $effect$. In other words, we regard the value of $y$ as depending on that of $x$. Both $x$ and $y$ are variables, but $x$ is the one that we operate upon, and $y$ is the “dependent variables”. In all the preceding chapter we have been trying to find out rules for the proportion which the dependent variation in $y$ as an $effect$. In other words, we regard the value of $y$ as depending on that of $x$. Both $x$ and $y$ are variables, but $x$ is the one that we operate upon, and $y$ is the “dependent variable”. In all the preceding chapter chapter we have been trying to find out rules for the proportion which the dependent variation in $y$ bears to the variation independently made in $x$.</p>
<p>Our next step is to find out what effect on the process of differentiating is caused by the presence of constants, that is, of numbers which don’t change when $x$ or $y$ change their values.</p>
<p>$Added Constants$ .</p>
<p>Let us begin with some simple case of an added constant, thus: Let</p>
<p>$$y = x^3 + 5.$$</p>
<p>Just as before, let us suppose $x$ to grow to $x +dx$ and $y$ to grow to $y+dy$</p>
<p>$$ Then:~y+dy=(x+dx)^3 +5 $$<br>$$ =x^3 + 3x^2·dx +5 $$</p>
<p>Neglecting the small quantities of higher orders, this becomes</p>
<p>$$ y +dy=x^3 + 3x^2·dx +5 $$</p>
<p>Subtract the original $y=x^3+5$ , and we have left:</p>
<p>$$dy=3x^2dx.$$</p>
<p>$$\frac {dy} {dx} = 3x^2.$$</p>
<p>So the 5 has quite disappeared. It added nothing to the growth of $x$, and does not enter into the differential coefficient. If we had put 7, or 700, or any other number, instead of $5$, it would have disappeared. So if we take the letter $a$, or $b$, or $c$ to represent any constant, it will simply disappear when differentiate.</p>
<p>If the additional constant had been of negative value, such as -5 or -b, it would equally have disappeared.</p>
<p>Multiplied Constants.</p>
<p>Take as a simple experiment this case:</p>
<p>Let $y=7x^2$. Then on proceeding as before we get:<br>$$y+dy=7(x+dx)^2$$</p>
<p>$$<br>=7{\left. x^2 +2x·dx + (dx)^2 \right}<br>$$</p>
<p>$$=7x^2 +14x·dx + 7(dx)^2.$$</p>
<p>Then, subtracting the original $y=7x^2$, and neglecting the last term, we have</p>
<p>$$dy=14x·dx$$<br>$$\frac {dy} {dx} = 14x.$$</p>
<p>Let us illustrate this example by working out the graphs of the equations $y=7x^2$ and $\frac {dy} {dx} = 14x.$ by assigning to $x$ a set of sucessive values, $0,1,2,3,$ etc. and finding the corresponding values of $y$ and of $\frac {dy} {dx}.$</p>
<p>These values we tabulate as follows:</p>

<p>Carefully coompare the two figures, and verify by inspection that the height of the ordinate of the derived curve, <a href="#pic1">Fig.61</a>, is proportional to the slope of the original curve, ( See <a href="#pic1">here</a> about slopes of curves). <a href="#pic">Figure</a>, at the corresponding value of $x$. To the left of the origin, while the original curve slopes negatively (that is, downward from left to right ) the corresponding ordinates of the derived curve are negative.</p>
<p>Now if we look back at <a href="#pic1">here</a>, we shall see that simply differentiating $x^2$ gives us $2x$. So that the differential coefficient of $7x^2$ is just 7 times as big as that of $x^2$. If we had taken $8x^2$, the differential coefficient would have come out 8 times as great as that of $x^2$. If we put $y=ax^2$, we shall get:<br>$$ \frac {dy} {dx} = a × 2x.$$</p>
<p>If we had begun with $y=ax^n$, we should have had $\frac {dy} {dx} = a × nx^{n-1}.$ So that any mere multiplication by a constant reappears as mere multiplication when the thing is differentiated. And, what is true about multiplication is equally true about division: for if, in the example above, we had taken as the constant $\frac {1} {7}$ instead of 7, we should have had the smae $\frac {1} {7}$ come out in the result after differentiation.</p>
<p>Some Further Examples. Thes following further examples, fully worked out, will enable you to master completely the process of differentiation as applied to ordinary algebraical expressions, and enable you to word out by yourself the examples give at the end of this chapter.</p>
<p>(1)Differentiate $y=\frac {x^5} {7} - \frac {3} {5}$<br>$\frac {3} {5}$ is an added constant and vanishes (see <a href="4.SIMPLEST_CASES.md#123}">here</a><br>)</p>
<p>We may then wirte at one</p>
<p>$$ \frac {dy} {dx} = \frac {1} {7} × 5 × x^{5-1},$$</p>
<p>$$or~ \frac {dy} {dx} = \frac {5} {7} x^4$$</p>
<p>(2)Differentiate $y= \sqrt{x} - \frac {1} {2} \sqrt {a}$</p>
<p>The term $\frac {1} {2} \sqrt {a}$ vanishes, being an added constant; and as $a \sqrt {x}$, in the index form, is written $ax^{\frac {1} {2}}$, we have</p>
<p>$$ \frac {dy} {dx} = a × \frac {1} {2} × x^{\frac {1} {2} -1} = \frac {a} {2} × x^{- \frac {1} {2}}$$</p>
<p>$$or~ \frac {dy} {dx} = \frac {a} {2\sqrt{x}}$$</p>
<p>If $ay + bx = by -ax + (x+y) \sqrt {a^2-b^2}$, find tie differential coefficient of $y$ with respect to $x$.</p>
<p>As a rule an expression of this kind will need a little more knowledge than we have acquired so far; it is, howerverm always worth while to try whether the expression can be put in a simpler form.</p>
<p>First we must try to bring it into the form $y$ = some expression involving $x$ only.</p>
<p>The expression may be written</p>
<p>$$ (a-b)y + (a+b)x =(x+y)\sqrt {a^2 - b^2}$$</p>
<p>Squaring, we get</p>
<p>$$(a-b)^2y^2 +(a+b)^2x^2+2(a+b)(a-b)xy = (x^2 + y^2 + 2xy)(a^2-b^2);$$</p>
<p>which simplifies to</p>
<p>$$(a-b)^2 + (a+b)^2x^2=x^2(a^2-b^2)+y^2(a^2-b^2)$$<br>$$or~[(a-b)^2-(a^2-b^2)]y^2 = [(a^2-b^2)-(a+b)^2]x^2;$$</p>
<p>hence</p>
<p>$$y=\sqrt {\frac {a+b} {a-b}x} and \sqrt{dy} {dx}= \sqrt {a+b}{a-b}.$$</p>
<p>(4)The volume of a cylinder of radius $r$ and height $h$ is given by the formula $V =\pi{r}^2h.$ Find the rate of variation of volumn withe the radius r = 5.5 in. and h = 20 in. If $r<del>=</del>h$, find the dimensions of the cylinder so that a change of 1 in. in radiu cause a change of 400 cub. in. in the volume.</p>
<p>The rate of variation of $V$ with regard to $r$ is</p>
<p>$$\frac {dV} {dr} = 2\pi{rh}.$$</p>
<p>If r = 5.5 in. and h = 20 in this becomes 690.8. It means that a change of radius of 1 inch will cause a change of volume of 690.8 cub. This can be easily verified, for the volumes with $r$ = 5 and $r$ =6 are 1570 cub. in. and 2260.8 cub.in. respectively, and 2260.8 - 1570 = 690.8.</p>
<p>Also, if</p>
<p>$$ r<del>=</del>h, \frac {dV} {dr} = 2\pi{r}^2 = 400 and r<del>=</del>h=<del>\sqrt {\frac {400} {2\pi}}</del>=~7.98in$$</p>
<p>(5) The reading $\theta$ of $F\acute{e}ry$’ s Radiation pyrometer is related to the Centigrade temperature $t$ of the observed body by the relation.</p>
<p>$$\frac {\theta} {\theta}_1 = (\frac {t} {t_1})^4$$</p>
<p>Where ${\theta}_1$ is the reading corresponding to known temperature $t_1$ of the observed body.</p>
<p>Compare the sensitiveness of the pyrometer at temperature 800℃、1000℃、1200℃、 given that it read <strong>25</strong>  when the tempeture was 1000℃.</p>
<p>The sensitiveness is the rate of variation of the reading with the tempeture, that is<br>$$\frac {d \theta} {t_1^4} = \frac {25t^4} {1000^4},$$</p>
<p>and we have</p>
<p>$$\frac {d \theta} {t_1^4} = \frac {25t^4} {1000^4}=\frac {t^3} {10,000,000,000}.$$</p>
<p>When t =800, 1000 and 1200, we get $\frac {d \theta} {dt}<del>=</del>0.0512.$ 0.1 and 0.1728 respectively.</p>
<p>The sensitiveness is approximately doubled from $800^。$ to $1000^。$, and becomes three quarters as great again up to $1200^。$.</p>
